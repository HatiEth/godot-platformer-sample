# Advanced 2D Platformer Sample

This sample spotlights some advanced features which are regularly used in 2D platforming games.

**As of creation (16.8.2015) this requires self-build Godot version, due to certain features we use.**


## Project structure (not really part of the tutorial - just an information for readers)

* /             # repository root dir, contains VCS dir and configuration files, Builds (ignored by VCS ofc) and anything game related (raw assets, docs, licenses etc.)
    * Builds/   # where your builds for various platforms should go
    * game/     # contains all the real game related stuff
        * Assembly/     # Assembly I call something which has to be tinkered together, mainly prototypes / prefabs; resembles main project structure
        * {{AssetType}}/     # Common assets used in all scenes/assemblies
